julia
=====

This package contains libraries to represent programs
of the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language in Curry.
In order to executed programs generated with these libraries,
a [Julia compiler](https://julialang.org/downloads/) should be
installed.

The directory `examples` contains a simple example for
the use of these libraries.


Developer note
--------------

The current package supports only the representation
of a small subset of Julia programs (required to translate
Curry programs into Julia programs). Interested people
are invited to extend the library.
